# 100-Days-of-Code-Python

Day 7:
Hangman
It replicates the concept of the game Hangman. It served to consolidate knowledge acquired about lists, if and while logic, and random functions.

Day 8:
Ceaser's Cipher (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
The program encodes or decodes a message entered by the user. It was designed to accept integer numbers (positive or negative).

Day 9:
Blind Auction
This program accepts an 'n' number of users, each entering the amount they are willing to pay in this silent auction. The program accepts numbers with a maximum of two decimal places. It was a great project to begin studying dictionaries in Python.

Day 11:
Blackjack
A mini Blackjack game.
This project was great to consolidate and apply all the concepts learned up to this point. Such as functions with inputs and/or outputs, lists, dictionaries, nested lists, as well as programming logic.

Day 15:
Coffee Machinhe
A simple Python console program that simulates a coffee machine.
You can order espresso, latte, or cappuccino, insert coins, receive change, check remaining resources, and turn the machine off.
It checks ingredient availability and payment before preparing the drink.

Day 17:
Quiz Project
A simple quiz game developed as the first project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The game presents True or False questions, allowing players to test their knowledge in a fun and interactive way. All questions are sourced from the Open Trivia Database (opentdb.com).

Day 20 and 21:
A classic Snake game built with Python’s turtle graphics module.
    - The snake moves continuously and grows longer each time it eats food.
    - The score increases with every piece of food eaten.
    - The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or with its own body.
    - Smooth controls prevent instant 180° turns, making the gameplay more natural.
    - The snake gradually speeds up with each food item collected, increasing the challenge.
This project is a fun way to practice object-oriented programming in Python and to get hands-on experience with game loops, collision detection, and event-driven input handling.
